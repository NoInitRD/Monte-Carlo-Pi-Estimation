# Monte-Carlo-Pi-Estimation
An example of the Monte Carlo method of Pi approximation written in Intel x86_64.

To use this you will need to enable command line compilation and assembling on windows.

This program consists of a grid with a circle inside. It estimates Pi by generating random points inside this grid and checking whether they fall inside the circle.

Here is a visual example:
